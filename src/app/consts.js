      description: `A website to connect creative independents together to work on projects and grow their portfolios, done for a team hackathon.`,
      problem: `For this hackathon, our team wanted to address a problem we noticed in the creative and tech industry. The tech industry is a growing community consisting of students, freelancers, and employees taking on different fields. A certain branch of the tech industry that exercises “creative independence” are those in Design, Engineering, and Product. In this branch, projects play a significant role in upping one’s portfolio. However, when projects require collaborative work, tech aspirants, especially those who are new to the industry or field, may not know who to reach out to. This is because they have limited resources, knowledge, and no community to reach out to. Topping off this accessibility gap is also the difficulty of recruiting passionate and compatible collaborators who remain committed to the project. Not only is it a question of how to foster a sense of community, but also of how to better find collaborators for side projects.`,
      process: `For research, I crafted had an initial survey of individuals in the industries of design, engineering, and product who were interested in working on projects. Participants were chosen were invited to an hour interview in an attempt to understand how collaboration is scouted by tech aspirants and the challenges they face. The research found that individuals struggled to get experience working on collaborative projects without having to apply for actual jobs. Moreover, they faced challenges looking for collaborators who were willing to work with them without some sort of compensation. Our team concluded that there are many individuals who want to collaborate, but don't know where to find like-minded people.`,
      solution: `Our team created a website that connects tech aspirants who exercise “creative independence” to one another for collaborative work on projects they can add to their experiences and portfolios. This website also aims to build a peer-to-peer network or a “creative independent” community that fosters creativity and innovation by allowing them to brainstorm various projects to work on together. Its main goal is to be the gateway for their career through upskilling and collaboration.`,

      description: `A repurposed Notion for a new market segment: the Product Management/agile market. Done for the UBC Product Management Club's Fellowship.`,
      problem: `For this project, the goal was to re-purpose an existing product for a new market segment. I decided to work on Notion, a project management, note-taking tool aimed at helping users collaborate and increase productivity. When thinking about the market segment I wanted to target, I realized that there Notion was a popular app being used in the product design/management and agile market due to versatility and features like Kanban boards, but lacked some of the aspects that are necessary to build products. Notion lacks any whiteboard or freeform feature that allows PMs to sketch out roadmaps, ideate on user designs, or create user journeys or flows. Despite majority of their product research being hosted on their Notion workspace, they are forced to rely on external third-party tools like Miro or Figma. This shows that Notion is potentially losing out on capitalizing on the market segment that they are already a part of, or even gaining new potential users.`,
      process: `To better understand how Notion fits into the workflows of product managers and designers, I conducted research into its company vision, feature set, and competitive landscape. I started by analyzing how PMs currently use Notion and what tools they rely on to fill in the gaps. I also looked at Notion’s stated mission—to be a flexible, all-in-one tool customizable for any workflow—and evaluated how well that mission holds up for agile product teams. This led me to identify a clear opportunity: while Notion is commonly used to organize research, documents, and task boards, it doesn’t support early-stage ideation or visual collaboration. I then studied tools like Miro and Milanote, and conducted a competitive feature comparison to see how Notion stacks up against direct and indirect competitors. Finally, I created user personas and mapped key user needs to determine what features would best support collaborative product planning inside the Notion ecosystem.`,
      solution: `Based on my research, I proposed a whiteboard feature that would allow users to add a freeform canvas directly into their Notion pages. This component would function like any other block—resizable, embeddable, and easy to move around—but would include tools like drawing, shapes, sticky notes, and arrows. Users could sketch roadmaps, create user flows, or brainstorm with teammates, all within the same workspace where they document and plan. The whiteboard would also support real-time collaboration, letting team members see each other’s edits and cursors as they work. By embedding this functionality directly into Notion, the feature helps reduce tool-switching and offers a more seamless experience for agile teams. The solution stays true to Notion’s modular structure while expanding its utility to cover the earlier, more creative stages of product development.`,

      problem: `Female-identifying entrepreneurs and business owners are very under-represented, with only 16% of Canadian small business owners being women. Through further research, I found that female businesses profit less compared to male businesses and tend to be less successful. Due to the lack of access and opportunities that women face, female-owned businesses tend to become relatively unpopular.`,
      process: `We decided to address the issue of the lack of women in the business/entrepreneurship field. Through my research, I found that women tend to be underrepresented in the field because 1) they are demotivated to enter the field as it is male-dominated and 2) because it is male-dominated, the most popular/successful businesses tend to be owned by men. So, in order to address this, we came up with an idea for an e-commerce website that focused on female entrepreneurs, allowing the platform to give a spotlight on their business and promote the selling of their products.`,
      solution: `To remedy the problem, our team created entreprenHER, a web application that aims to showcase the 16% and allow them to promote their talents and creativity through the platform. Female-identifying individuals can host their online stores on the platform which consumers can purchase from. Through this, users can directly support women entrepreneurs by buying their products.`,

      description: `A platform for professors to earn passive income by uploading lecture materials and resources for students to freely access, done for a team hackathon.`,
      problem: `The problem I identified stems from the fact that university/high school students are too limited in their range of learning; they only obtain direct education from a certain teacher for a certain subject. What if the student would like to gain extra practice and knowledge to supplement their learning, or to find other courses taught by such an instructor? They want extra resources for their school classes, however, most prime sources are behind a paywall. On the other hand, for instructors, and universities, funding, and salaries have long been a pain point. Professors want to grow a platform to share their knowledge as teachers but have no incentive to give out their knowledge for free..`,
      process: `I developed a problem statement: Professors want to grow a platform to share their knowledge and make extra passive income from sharing their teaching, while students want extra resources for their school classes, but most sources are locked behind a paywall. This happens because the lectures given by professors aren't sufficient, or students need more resources and practice or a different form of explanation. Most educational content is also locked behind paywalls that students are unwilling to breach.`,
      solution: `The solution was to create a platform to connect students and professors. onlyProfs aims to help professors share the knowledge and content that they create, whether it be lectures, assignments (with solutions), or their research, and provide easy access for students to learn from those materials free of charge. Professors can upload materials and be able to earn based on the number of views or clicks they receive from their uploaded content. Meanwhile, students can access additional learning resources, completely, free of charge, from a range of their preferred instructors, along with accessing the other courses they have taught. The site would primarily make income off user clicks (Google advertisements), or make use of subscription services like Coil.`,

      problem: `As a UX/UI Designer student at the UBC Faculty of Applied Science, I was tasked with redesigning the existing website of a laboratory under the faculty with a front-end developer. The lab is a research group at UBC that focuses on transportation systems. I needed to rediscover the website by evaluating its target audiences, and updating its UI design to make it coherent with other faculty websites. Moreover, I needed to make the lab’s research display on the website more accessible to provide a platform for the lab to showcase their research.`,
      process: `Before speaking to the client/lab director, I did an in-depth inventory audit of all the pages on the website and the content on each page to understand the website’s structure. I also did a competitive analysis and comparison of other faculty websites to understand what I should be basing my design off of. After this, I ideated on the website's discovery to identify necessary questions to ask the client. This was to identify their prioritization of target audiences to figure out how to arrange content on the site.`,
      solution: `The client identified two main client groups: the general public and prospective lab researchers. The general public would be interested in viewing the website to learn more about the lab's research projects while prospective members would visit the website to gauge their interest in joining the lab, as well as view the instructions to apply to the lab. After conducting the user research interview with the client to identify the website objectives and product requirements, I created a sitemap to re-organize the website based on target audience prioritization. I identified the scope of the website to mainly focus on revamping the homepage as well as the research projects page.`,
